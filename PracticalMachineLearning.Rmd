This is an R Markdown document for a Practical Machine Learning assignment.

#-- library definitions
```{r}
library(caret)
library(rattle)
library(rpart)
```
#-- training data
```{r}
pml.training <- read.csv("C:/COURSERA/Machine Learning II/pml-training.csv")
```
#-- remove variables 
```{r}
##- sequential counter, user name, time stamps, windows
train <- pml.training[,-(1:7)]
##- near zero variables (defined in caret package)
train <- train[,-nearZeroVar(train)]
##- variables with very large counts of missing values 
train <- train[, colSums(is.na(train)) < 19000]
##- variables with pairwise correlation greater than 0.90 
train <- train[, -findCorrelation(cor(train[,1:52]), 0.90)]
```
#-- rpart fit
```{r}
rpartFit <- rpart(classe ~., data=train, control=rpart.control(maxdepth=10))
```
#-- fancy rpart fit plot
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fancyRpartPlot(rpartFit)
```
#-- testing data
```{r}
pml.testing <- read.csv("C:/COURSERA/Machine Learning II/pml-testing.csv")
```
#-- rpart predictions
```{r}
rpartPred <- predict(rpartFit, newdata=pml.testing)
```

rpartPred contains probabilities for classes A to E.
My answers are based on the largest probability across the classes.

```{r}
answers <- c("C","A","C","C","A","C","D","D","A","A",
             "B","B","C","A","E","A","A","B","B","B")
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(answers)
```
